# Portfolio-Week2-Bootcamp
My first Portfolio, for bootcamp-week2 

This is first ever developed portfolio, the goal was to showcase some of capabilites and with HTML and CSS while telling the user about myself. 

its fairly easy to use hover over the images, they'll expand when you hover over them, when you click on them, it will guide you to a page that loads and says "Coming Soon"
